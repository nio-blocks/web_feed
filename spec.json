Feed fields will be prepended with `feed_`. The attribute `updated` will be set even if the feed format does not have it (ex. for rss feeds `updated` is set to `pubDate`. The following is a list of commonly include attributes, but note that not all will be included on every signal:\n```\n{\nupdated: datetime,\nid: string,\nfeed_title: string,\ntitle: string,\nsummary: string,\nlink: string\n}\n```"
